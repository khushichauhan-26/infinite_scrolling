# infinite_scrolling
1. Overview
In the modern era of the web, user experience stands
paramount. An aspect of this user experience is the
ability to fetch and display content without any noticeable
interruptions. Gone are the days when users were
accustomed to clicking ‘Next’ on pagination. Now, they
expect content to automatically load as they scroll,
popularly known as infinite scrolling. This feature can be
seen on numerous modern websites, from social media
platforms like Twitter and Facebook to news websites.
2. Objectives
By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand the basics and the mechanics behind the
infinite scroll feature.
- Fetch data from a public API using Fetch and
Async/Await.
- Display this fetched data seamlessly as the user scrolls
down the page.
- Enhance the user experience by adding a CSS loader
animation to indicate data fetching.
